I want to be able to add a file via the search bar, and have the llm immediately write into it based on a prompt embedded into the search input like so:
```
Thorsten Rotbart #Person #5e "A simple minded craftsman whi is an expert at smithing but not much else"
```
Should parse the Filename into `Thorsten Rotbart #Person #5e`
